## Sound Maker

Application working in a background providing Tray icon for changing Gain, Frequency and option to add to Autostart.

Developed for myself to overcome issue with my soundbar going into "power saving" kind of mode after 5 seconds od silence, which often resulted cutted off notification and dialogues.

### Options
* Gain - number from 0.0 to 1.0 (default: 0.001) - sets volume
* Frequency - number from 0.0 to the sky (default: 400) - sets frequency in Hz
* Add to Autostart - click first time to add to autostart, click second time to remove it

### Missing functionalities
1. Add option to save user settings in order to load them automaticaly when application starts. I may add something like this at someones request.
